# LED-States-Using-Timers
Students are instructed to program a microcontroller to control the states of LEDs using a timer. LEDs are to cycle through 4 states. There are two button controls, one button will pause/continue the blinking of the LEDs, will the other button is responsible for changing the state of the LED.
All code should be compiled perferably in MPLAB, but any IDE that is able to process the MIPS programming language is also sufficient.
